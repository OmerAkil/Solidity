The first way is the token's owner calls transferFrom with his address as the _from parameter, the address he wants to transfer to as the _to parameter, and the _tokenId of the token he wants to transfer.

The second way is the token's owner first calls approve with the address he wants to transfer to, and the _tokenID . The contract then stores who is approved to take a token, usually in a mapping (uint256 => address). Then, when the owner or the approved address calls transferFrom, the contract checks if that msg.sender is the owner or is approved by the owner to take the token, and if so it transfers the token to him.

Notice that both methods contain the same transfer logic. In one case the sender of the token calls the transferFrom function; in the other the owner or the approved receiver of the token calls it.

So it makes sense for us to abstract this logic into its own private function, _transfer, which is then called by transferFrom.

=> Libraries

/*
    Start by implementing the library

    implement "./safemath.sol";


    First we have the library keyword â€” libraries are similar to contracts but with a few differences. For our purposes, libraries allow us to use the using keyword, which automatically tacks on all of the library's methods to another data type:
*/
    using SafeMath for uint;
    // now we can use these methods on any uint
    uint test = 2;
    test = test.mul(3); // test now equals 6
    test = test.add(5); // test now equals 11

//  using SafeMath for uint256;
//  using SafeMath32 for uint32;
//  using SafeMath16 for uint16;

=> Assert vs require

function add(uint256 a, uint256 b) internal pure returns (uint256) {
    uint256 c = a + b;
    assert(c >= a);
    return c;
  }

/*
  assert is similar to require, where it will throw an error if false. The difference between assert and require is that require will refund the user the rest of their gas when a function fails, whereas assert will not. So most of the time you want to use require in your code; assert is typically used when something has gone horribly wrong with the code (like a uint overflow).
*/

/* So in a case like that you may want to change ++ to safemath form so you can get an error if something like overflow occurs */
